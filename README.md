# Asteroid-Dodge-JSGame
A very basic game made purely in HTML,CSS and Javascript which demonstrates the basic challenges which comes up while designing a game from scratch like
    * Character animation
    * Enemy Randomization
    * Obstacle Detection, etc.
    
#Just download the Zip and open the game.html file to play

The main js file is present in the _bin/_ folder named *script.js*

The js file has the following functions to handle the flow of the game
    
    * start()
    * stop()
    * makeObjects()
    * animate(element)
    * detectCollision(element)
    * addPlayer(element)
    * makeBullets()
    * animateBullet(bullet-element)
    * getHighScore() //cookies
    * getCurrentScore() //cookies
    * setHighScore(score) //cookies
    * setCurrentScore(score) //cookies
    * audioToggle()

The names are pretty self-explanatory. Study and experiment with the code a little bit to figure out how it works.
Then you can modify it any way you want. Good Luck!
